Manuela T.,2,"So disapointed! Everywhere in the internet is marked that there is a Google Store (similar to Apple) but no, here is absolutely nothing for public - even the water in the public toilet did not work. My family just told me to sell my android phone ... sad all the way from Switzerland, just to see the (pretty nice) Googleplex from the outside",a year ago

Kate Shao,5,"Love this company! Even though visitors cannot enter their office, but you can enjoy the awesome and beautiful outdoor area. It's pretty cool that sometimes you also can see some employees do exercise in the area.",6 years ago
Ishwor Bhusal,5,"A different world, completely unique experience, place where someone doesn't like to come out after entering into the campus.
Good Headquarters, Mountain View (Silicon Valley), California, United States of America",6 years ago
Okan S,5,Amazing and welcoming google complex in Silicon Valley. It is open to public. You can take a colourful google bike for free and take a tour in the campus. You can feel the philosophy of google in the campus which encourages its employees to think freely. A must visit place in Silicon Valley. After visiting apple headquarters and experiencing that there is nothing to do there i really enjoyed my googleplex visit.,8 years ago
